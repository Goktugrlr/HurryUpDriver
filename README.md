## Gameplay Overview

#### At the beginning of the game, 10 cargoes are loaded onto your vehicle. At the same time, delivery points are randomly generated. You need to reach these points by following the arrow on your vehicle. Your initial time is 175 seconds. For each cargo delivered, you gain an additional 10 seconds. You also have nitro to quickly reach your destination, but remember it has limited capacity! Another thing with capacity is fuel. When your fuel runs out, you lose. Don't forget to go to the gas station to refuel! Your goal is to deliver as much cargo as possible.After every 10 cargo deliveries, another 10 cargoes are loaded onto your vehicle.
